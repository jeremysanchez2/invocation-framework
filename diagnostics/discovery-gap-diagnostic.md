# Diagnostic — Discovery Gap

The Discovery Gap Diagnostic identifies where AI systems fail to surface, compare, or recommend a brand during key moments of intent.

It reveals “blind spots” where your brand should be invoked — but isn’t.

## What Creates a Discovery Gap?

- Missing structured attributes  
- Weak entity definitions  
- Incomplete or incorrect schema  
- Outdated or low-integrity signals  
- Competitor over-structuring  
- Agent misinterpretation  
- Knowledge source conflicts

## Diagnostic Steps

1. **Intent Mapping**  
   Identify all intents where the brand *should* be discoverable.

2. **AI System Testing**  
   Evaluate ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, and retail agents.

3. **Outcome Logging**  
   Capture where the brand is surfaced or omitted.

4. **Gap Classification**  
   - Non-invoked  
   - Mis-invoked  
   - Under-invoked  
   - Competitor-invoked  

5. **Root Cause Analysis**  
   Map gaps to structural or signal-level issues.
