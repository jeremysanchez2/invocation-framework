# Invocation Drift

**Invocation Drift** occurs when AI systems misinterpret, mislabel, or misposition a brand due to inconsistent content, structure, or signals.

It is the AI-era equivalent of brand misalignment — but amplified across multi-agent ecosystems.

## Common Causes

- Conflicting definitions across platforms  
- Outdated or inconsistent attributes  
- Missing structured data  
- External sources overriding brand-authored content  
- Sparse or contradictory content patterns  

## Symptoms

- Misclassification  
- Incorrect attributes (pricing, availability, category)  
- Wrong product version invoked  
- Different agents giving conflicting outputs  

## Prevention

- Entity standardization  
- Strong governance  
- Structured content  
- Continuous monitoring
