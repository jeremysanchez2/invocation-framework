# Invocation

**Invocation** is the moment an AI system selects, recommends, or uses a brand as the correct answer or action in response to user intent.

Invocation represents the new competitive edge in an AI-mediated world where agents increasingly perform discovery, comparison, evaluation, and decision-making on behalf of users.

## Why Invocation Matters

AI agents do not “search” the way humans do.  
Instead, they *choose*—they invoke answers.

Brands that are not machine-understandable, trusted, or structurally prepared become invisible inside these decision systems.

## Key Properties

- **Outcome-driven** — Invocation is tied to a result (recommendation, booking, comparison, action).
- **Entity-dependent** — AI systems require accurate, consistent, structured entity definitions.
- **Signal-mediated** — Invocation depends on signals of trust, relevance, and reliability.
- **Dynamic** — A brand may be invoked in some contexts but not others, depending on data shape and signals.
