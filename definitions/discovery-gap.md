# Discovery Gap

The **Discovery Gap** is the difference between total category demand and the portion of that demand a brand is eligible to capture inside AI systems.

AI agents mediate intent differently than traditional search.  
If a brand is not structurally invokable, it is excluded from the AI decision process — often without any visibility.

## Causes of Discovery Gap

- Missing or incomplete entity definitions  
- Inconsistent or unstructured content  
- Weak or conflicting signals  
- Lack of schema or metadata  
- Misalignment with model reasoning pathways  

## Effects

- Invisible demand loss  
- Missed recommendations  
- Missed category inclusion  
- Defaulting to competitors  
- Lower agent recall
