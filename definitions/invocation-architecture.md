# Invocation Architecture

**Invocation Architecture** is the structured system of content, data, signals, entities, and governance that enables a brand to be consistently invoked by AI systems.

It defines how a brand becomes machine-understandable, trustworthy, and usable by AI agents across discovery, reasoning, and decision pathways.

## Core Components

### 1. Machine-Readable Content  
Content that is structured, semantic, consistent, and optimized for model interpretation.

### 2. Entity Modeling  
Accurate, consistent definitions of products, services, locations, people, and their attributes.

### 3. Signal Infrastructure  
The set of trust, quality, and reliability signals that influence model selection.

### 4. Decision Path Alignment  
Aligning brand content with the reasoning pathways LLMs use when selecting answers.

### 5. Governance  
Processes that maintain accuracy, consistency, and integrity of brand data over time.

## Outcomes

- Higher inclusion in AI-mediated recommendations  
- Reduced misinterpretation and hallucination  
- Stronger reliability signals across LLM ecosystems  
- Persistent model trust
