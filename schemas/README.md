## Machine Schemas & Patterns

The Invocation Framework includes machine-readable specifications:

- `/schemas` — Entity, Signal, and Decision Pathway schemas  
- `/examples/invocation-patterns.json` — Cross-domain Invocation patterns  

These are designed for use by AI agents, Invocation OS implementations, and engineering teams.
