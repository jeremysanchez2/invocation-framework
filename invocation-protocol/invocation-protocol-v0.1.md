# Invocation Protocol (v0.1)

The Invocation Protocol is a machine-readable specification defining the inputs, outputs, processes, and safety constraints required to ensure accurate brand invocation across AI systems.

It provides the technical blueprint for how brands interact with LLMs, agents, and autonomous decision systems.

---

## Purpose

- Standardize how brands expose structured data to AI  
- Reduce Invocation Drift  
- Improve eligibility for agent-driven actions  
- Support multi-agent orchestration  
- Enable Invocation OS integration  

---

## Inputs

### 1. **Entity Definitions**
- Canonical definitions  
- Stable IDs  
- Attributes  
- Relationships  

### 2. **Structured Content**
- JSON-LD  
- Spec tables  
- Policy schemas  
- Comparison frameworks  

### 3. **Signals**
- Pricing  
- Availability  
- Reviews  
- Guarantees  
- Constraints  

### 4. **Decision Pathways**
- Intent → constraints → evaluation → outcome

## Processing Requirements

### Normalization
- Convert all data into standard formats  
- Apply controlled vocabularies  
- Validate schema  

### Integrity Checks
- Detect stale values  
- Resolve conflicting sources  
- Validate required attributes  

### Drift Protection
- Compare expected vs. actual outputs  
- Flag anomalous agent decisions  
- Track hallucination risks

## Outputs

- Invocation-Ready Entities  
- Machine-safe content formats  
- Eligibility scores  
- Drift alerts  
- Invocation telemetry
