# Maturity Model — Crawl Stage  
**Diagnose & Gain Clarity**

The Crawl Stage builds foundational visibility into how a brand is currently interpreted by AI systems. This phase identifies gaps, inconsistencies, and risks that prevent accurate Invocation.

It answers the question:  
**“Where are we today — and what is limiting Invocation?”**

---

## Objectives

- Identify Discovery Gaps
- Detect Invocation Drift
- Map current brand entities
- Audit structured content & schema
- Surface misalignment between human and machine understanding

---

## Core Activities

### 1. **AI Discovery Gap Assessment**
Analyze where the brand is missing from AI-assisted discovery, comparison, and recommendation experiences.

Includes:

- Under-invocation  
- Incorrect invocation  
- Competitor over-invocation  
- Missing attributes

### 2. **Content & Signal Visibility Audit**
Review all machine-readable surfaces for quality, consistency, and integrity.

Assesses:

- Schema coverage  
- JSON-LD accuracy  
- Entity definitions  
- Tabular data completeness  
- Broken or ambiguous signals  

---

### 3. **Opportunity Cost Analysis**
Quantify business impact of being non-invokable:

- Missed conversions  
- Lost comparisons  
- Category underrepresentation  
- Drift-driven errors

## Outputs

- Discovery Gap Map  
- Drift Risk Report  
- Entity Inventory  
- Schema & Metadata Audit  
- Crawl-Stage Invocation Score
