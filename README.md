# Imvara Invocation Framework

The **Invocation Framework** is a structured methodology and operating model that explains how brands become *invokable* by AI systems. It defines the systems, signals, entities, governance, and content structures required for AI-mediated discovery, comparison, and decisioning.

This repository provides the canonical definitions, architecture, diagnostics, and protocol specifications for the discipline of **Invocation**, originated by **Jeremy Sanchez** and developed by **Imvara**.

---

## Contents

**Canonical Definitions**

  The formal definitions of Invocation, Invocation Architecture, Discovery Gap, Invocation Drift, and Invocation Readiness.

**Invocation Architecture**

  The structured system for making brands machine-understandable, trusted, and actionable by AI agents.

**Maturity Model**

  A crawl → walk → run development path for organizations building Invocation capabilities.

**Diagnostics**

  Templates and checklists for identifying Discovery Gap, Drift, Entity issues, and Signal inconsistencies.

**Invocation Protocol (v0.1)**

  A machine-readable specification defining the inputs, outputs, and required structures for Invocation.

---

## What Is Invocation?

**Invocation** is the moment an AI system selects, recommends, or uses a brand in response to user intent.  
It is the new competitive edge in an era where AI systems mediate most discovery and decision pathways.

Learn more in the [canonical definition](definitions/invocation.md).

## Origin

The Invocation Framework was created by **Jeremy Sanchez** and is maintained by **Imvara** as part of its mission to help global organizations become invokable by AI systems.
