# Agent-Safe Design

Agent-Safe Design ensures that all content, data, and interactions are safe, accurate, and unambiguous for AI agents.

The goal is simple:

> Prevent LLMs and agents from making incorrect, unsafe, or brand-damaging decisions.

## Why Agent Safety Matters

Unsafe or ambiguous inputs lead to:

- Hallucinated claims  
- Incorrect comparisons  
- Misinterpretations of policies  
- Wrong recommendations  
- Legal or regulatory risk  
- Erosion of brand trust  

Agent-Safe Design provides the guardrails.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Precision Over Persuasion**
Traditional marketing copy prioritizes persuasion.  
Agent-safe content prioritizes:

- clarity  
- factual accuracy  
- consistent terminology  
- verifiable claims  

### 2. **Structured Assertions**
Brand promises, guarantees, policies, and specifications must be:

- machine-validated  
- version-controlled  
- unambiguous  

### 3. **Policy Truth Tables**
Define what agents *can* and *cannot* say about:

- warranties  
- guarantees  
- contraindications  
- exclusions  
- limitations  
- legal boundaries  

### 4. **Risk Segmentation**
Identify high-risk content categories:

- Health  
- Finance  
- Safety-critical instructions  
- Regulated industries  

Apply stricter governance to these categories.

### 5. **Outcome Alignment**
Ensure AI agents interpret actions safely:

- “Book a consultation”  
- “Compare plans”  
- “Recommend a product”  
- “Find the best option”  

Each action should have a safe, defined pathway.
