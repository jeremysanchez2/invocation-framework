# Entity Governance

Entity Governance ensures that all brand, product, service, and experience entities are structured, consistent, and machine-interpretable across AI systems.

Without standardized entities, AI cannot reliably determine:

- What your brand does  
- Who it’s for  
- How it compares  
- When to invoke it  

Entity errors are one of the top causes of **Invocation Drift**.

## What Are Entities?

Entities represent the “things that matter” in your brand’s universe:

- Products  
- Services  
- Locations  
- People  
- Features  
- Pricing types  
- Mission/values  
- Customer segments  
- Attributes  
- Outcomes  

An AI agent relies on entities — not pages — to make decisions.

## Components of Strong Entity Governance

### 1. **Canonical Entity Definitions**
Each entity receives a stable, authoritative definition with:

- Name  
- Description  
- Key attributes  
- Relationships  
- Accepted synonyms  
- Exclusions/constraints  

### 2. **Consistent Identifiers**
Use stable IDs across:

- JSON-LD  
- Schema.org  
- Sitemaps  
- Product feeds  
- Internal data sources  
- Agent APIs  

### 3. **Relationship Modeling**
Mapping how entities connect:

- A service *solves* a problem  
- A feature *enables* an outcome  
- A product *compares to* another  
- A location *serves* a region  

### 4. **Version Control & Change Governance**
Every entity change triggers:

- Regeneration of structured content  
- Update to knowledge graphs  
- Drift risk assessment  
- Re-ingestion by AI systems

## Why This Matters for Invocation

AI systems prefer brands with:

- Clear definitions  
- Stable identifiers  
- Well-structured relationships  
- Transparent attributes  
- High data integrity  

Entity Governance is how a brand becomes **computationally trustworthy**.
