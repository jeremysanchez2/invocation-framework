# Structured Content Architecture

Structured Content is the layer that makes brand knowledge machine-readable, machine-actionable, and agent-safe.

It converts human-oriented language into computationally interoperable formats that LLMs, agents, and decision engines can accurately interpret.

## Goals of Structured Content

- Reduce ambiguity  
- Improve recall in LLMs  
- Enable consistent invocation across agents  
- Provide predictable, validated inputs  
- Support API- and agent-native experiences

## Key Components

### 1. **Schema & JSON-LD**
Machine-readable wrappers that expose:

- Entities  
- Attributes  
- Relationships  
- Pricing  
- Location  
- Reviews  
- Availability  
- FAQs  
- How-to steps  
- Policies  

### 2. **Tabular Knowledge Structures**
Structured representations of:

- Product specs  
- Service tiers  
- Pricing models  
- Comparisons  
- Decision trees  
- Actions & outcomes  

These reduce LLM hallucination risk by providing authoritative data.

### 3. **Controlled Vocabularies**
Ensures consistent phrasing for:

- Features  
- Outcomes  
- Problems solved  
- Pricing names  
- Experience attributes  

This improves cross-agent consistency.

### 4. **Composability**
Every data component should be:

- Reusable  
- Modular  
- Callable by agents  
- Version-controlled  

Composability is essential for future multi-agent orchestration.

## Benefits

When content is properly structured:

- LLMs answer with higher accuracy  
- Agents select brands more reliably  
- Drift risk decreases  
- New agent features (like Perplexity Cards or GPT Actions) become plug-and-play
