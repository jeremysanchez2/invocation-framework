# AI Decision Pathways

Decision Pathways define how AI systems choose between competing brands, products, or services.  
They map the sequence of evaluations, signals, and outcomes an AI agent uses to determine the best option for a given user intent.

Understanding these pathways gives brands strategic control over how they are invoked.

## Why Decision Pathways Matter

AI agents do not simply retrieve information.  
They:

1. Interpret intent  
2. Evaluate structured data  
3. Compare options  
4. Weigh trust signals  
5. Generate a selection or action  

Brands that understand and align with these pathways become more invokable.

## Components of a Decision Pathway

### 1. **Intent Classification**
- Navigational  
- Informational  
- Comparative  
- Transactional  
- Operational (“do” intents)  

### 2. **Constraint Evaluation**
Agents test whether a brand meets required constraints:

- Price thresholds  
- Availability  
- Geography  
- Policy requirements  
- Safety requirements  
- Feature criteria  

### 3. **Attribute Weighting**
Each attribute is weighted differently depending on the intent.

Example:  
For “best family SUV,” safety may have 3× the weight of price.

### 4. **Option Comparison**
Agents rank options using models such as:

- Weighted scoring  
- Utility functions  
- Contextual matching  
- Similarity embeddings  

### 5. **Outcome Optimization**
Agents choose the option that maximizes the likelihood of a successful outcome.

In short:

> **Invocation is a competition — and Decision Pathways are the rules.**

## How Brands Use Decision Pathways

- Inform content & schema strategy  
- Build agent-native comparison tables  
- Align structured attributes to weighted priorities  
- Reduce Drift by eliminating ambiguous data  
- Improve eligibility for high-intent actions (e.g., booking, scheduling, purchasing)

Decision Pathways transform Invocation from guesswork into a predictable system.
