# Imvara Invocation Framework — Overview

The Imvara Invocation Framework is the first open standard for making brands
**machine-understandable, machine-trusted, and machine-invokable** by AI systems.

It defines the structured system of:

- **Entities**
- **Signals**
- **Decision Pathways**
- **Structured Content**
- **Governance**
- **Invocation Protocols**
- **Machine Schemas**

This framework enables AI systems (OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs, agents, and assistants)
to select, recommend, compare, or use a brand reliably — without hallucination.

Invocation is not “SEO for AI.”  
It is **computational trust for autonomous decision-making.**

## Why This Matters
AI agents are replacing search, comparison engines, category-navigation, and micro-decisions.
Brands that are not machine-readable become algorithmically invisible — even if they dominate
traditional search or advertising channels.

The Invocation Framework closes this gap.
